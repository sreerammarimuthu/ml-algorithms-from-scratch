# Machine Learning Algorithms from scratch

This repository offers three classic machine-learning implementations in pure Python/NumPy, no black-box libraries. Including Logistic Regression (SGD), Linear Regression (gradient descent), and ID3 Decision Tree implemented from scratch to break down core concepts through interactive, hands-on exploration. So we can see exactly how each algorithm learns from data. Transparent, framework-free implementations of essential ML models.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- **Stochastic-GD Logistic Regression**  
  Binary classifier built from first principles. Illustrates how batch size and learning rate drive convergence and shape decision boundaries.
  
- **Vectorized Linear Regression**  
  Efficient least-squares fitting via gradient descent. Leverages NumPy matrix operations to compare performance against naive loops.
  
- **ID3 Decision Tree**  
  Entropy-based splits on categorical features. Demonstrates information gain calculations, recursive tree building, and majority-vote leaf labeling.
