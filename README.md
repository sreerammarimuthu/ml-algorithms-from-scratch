# Machine Learning Algorithms from scratch

This repository offers three classic machine-learning implementations in pure Python/NumPy, no black-box libraries. Including Logistic Regression (SGD), Linear Regression (gradient descent), and ID3 Decision Tree implemented from scratch to break down core concepts through interactive, hands-on exploration. So we can see exactly how each algorithm learns from data. Transparent, framework-free implementations of essential ML models.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- **Stochastic-GD Logistic Regression**  
  Implements logistic regression training with stochastic gradient descent. You can adjust batch size and learning rate to observe their impact on convergence speed and the shape of the decision boundary.
  
- **Vectorized Linear Regression**  
  Uses NumPy vector operations to perform gradient-descent linear regression. Compare its execution time and clarity against a basic loop-based approach.
  
- **ID3 Decision Tree**  
  Builds a decision tree on categorical data by computing entropy and information gain. Shows you how recursive splits form the tree and how leaf nodes decide the final class by majority vote.
